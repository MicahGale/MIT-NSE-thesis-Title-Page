    Reactor Physics is not always an intuitive subject for students to understand. When nuclear engineering was beginning as a field it was common for students to complete measurements on sub-critical reactors, which could not sustain a fission chain reaction, in order to develop a physical intuition. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has one such reactor, a graphite exponential pile, which was previously unused for possibly decades. In this thesis the MIT Graphite Exponential Pile was returned to experimental operation, and a prototypic student experiment was completed. The material buckling was found by indium foil activations completed with a plutonium-beryllium source. From this it was calculated the pile would have to be a cube with sides that are 5.42m long to become a critical reactor. This proof of concept makes it possible for mens et manus based education at MIT for reactor physics.
